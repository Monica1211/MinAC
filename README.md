# MinAC Overview

Given any input distribution and error bound, this project implements the exact-synthesis method to automatically produce minimal-area approximate 4-2 compressors. To directly obtain an area-optimal circuit using an industrial gate library, gates with multiple outputs are taken into account during the exact synthesis.
